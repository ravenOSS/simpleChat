This repo is for Learn to Code Colorado for the Web. express0.js demos a basic server. indexMin.html provides the basic page layout.
1. Download and install Node.js
www.nodejs.org
On the command line (terminal) check installation by issuing:
node --version
If you get a message about node not being found, take a look at the docs on nodejs.org.
NPM should automatically install
npm --version
2. On github.com in the 'https://github.com/ravenOSS/simpleChat.git' repository, look for the green clone/download button. Choose "download zip" or another method if you're familiar with git.
Download the zip file to a working directory of your choosing and unzip.
3. In terminal, install all the necessary node packages by issuing "npm install --save"
You'll see a stream of messages as the packages install. A node_modules directory will be created.
4. In terminal, issue "npm start"
This should give you a message about listening on a certain port.
5. In a browser, type "localhost:port"
(localhost:3000)
6. You should see a chat screen.
7. Open a second browser window and enter same address.
8. Enter message in one window and check the other window.
9. You can also launch the server with an IP address and port (eg 192.168.0.150:3000s) and others on the same network can plug in the same address on their browsers to have a multi-person chat.
9. In 'https://github.com/ravenOSS/ltChatLite.git' there is another chat application that stores the messages in mongodb and when a user loads the page, the messages should load. Follow install instructions that somewhat overlap these.
